# From Flight Decks to DeFi

## The Journey
- **Navy Nuclear Engineer** - Learned systems thinking under pressure on aircraft carriers
- **30-Year Tech Evolution** - Network admin to Engineering Manager at katana
- **Four Spinning Plates Philosophy** - Physical health, mental health, family, financial success
- **Current Mission** - Making DeFi accessible to regular people through real experience

## Why I'm Learning DeFi in Public
After three decades in tech, I've seen every major shift from mainframes to cloud to mobile to DevOps. Web3/DeFi feels like the biggest opportunity yet - but it's buried under jargon and degen culture. 

I'm learning it the right way, applying 30 years of engineering discipline to evaluate protocols, assess risks, and share real insights. No hype, no get-rich-quick schemes - just systematic learning from someone who's navigated major tech transitions before.

## The Four Spinning Plates Framework
Peak performance isn't about choosing between career success and life balance. It's about optimizing four critical systems simultaneously:

- **Physical Health** - Completed a 100K ultra-marathon while working full-time in demanding tech roles
- **Mental Health** - Stress management techniques learned from high-pressure military and tech environments
- **Family Relationships** - Maintaining deep connections through decades of career growth and geographic moves
- **Financial Success** - Building wealth through calculated risks, from traditional tech careers to exploring DeFi

The framework comes from recognizing that these aren't competing priorities - they're interconnected systems that reinforce each other when properly balanced.

## My Approach to DeFi
I evaluate DeFi protocols like I evaluate tech infrastructure - with systematic risk assessment, deep technical analysis, and healthy skepticism. I'm not here to shill tokens or promise easy money. I'm here to learn alongside you and share what works.
