# Strength Training After 40: What Actually Works

*Sample post - replace with your actual content*

Recovery takes longer. Injuries happen easier. But building strength after 40 isn't just possibleâ€”it's essential for long-term health and vitality.

## The Reality Check

Your 20-year-old body could bounce back from anything. Your 40+ body requires strategy, consistency, and respect for recovery.

## What Changes After 40

- **Recovery time** increases significantly
- **Form matters more** than ever
- **Progressive overload** needs to be more gradual
- **Mobility work** becomes non-negotiable

## The Program That Works

Instead of chasing complex routines, focus on:

1. **Compound movements** - squats, deadlifts, presses
2. **Consistent schedule** - 3x/week is better than sporadic intensity
3. **Recovery protocols** - sleep, nutrition, stress management
4. **Long-term thinking** - sustainable progress over quick gains
