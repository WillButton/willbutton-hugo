# About Will

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I write about three things I'm passionate about:

## Crypto Technology for the Over-40 Crowd
The crypto space moves fast, but experience matters. I break down complex blockchain technologies, DeFi protocols, and investment strategies with the perspective that comes from decades in tech and finance.

## Fitness
Staying in shape gets more challenging and more important as we age. I share practical fitness advice, workout routines, and nutrition tips that work for busy professionals.

## Outdoors
There's something restorative about spending time in nature that grounds us and provides perspective. I write about outdoor activities, gear reviews, conservation efforts, and the philosophy of connecting with the natural world.
