# Engineering Discipline Meets DeFi Analysis

After 30 years evaluating tech systems - from nuclear reactor controls to cloud infrastructure - I'm applying the same systematic approach to DeFi protocols. Here's my framework for separating signal from noise in the Web3 space.

## The Four-Layer Risk Assessment

### 1. Technical Infrastructure Risk
Just like evaluating a new cloud platform, I start with the foundation:
- Smart contract audits and bug bounty history
- Blockchain security (L1 vs L2 considerations)
- Key developer backgrounds and track records
- Open source code quality and community contributions

### 2. Economic Model Viability
Does the tokenomics actually make sense long-term?
- Revenue sources and sustainability
- Inflation/deflation mechanisms
- Liquidity depth and market making
- Historical performance under stress

### 3. Governance and Centralization Risk
Who really controls this protocol?
- Token distribution and voting power
- Multi-sig wallet configurations  
- Administrative key holders
- Upgrade mechanisms and timelines

### 4. Market and Regulatory Risk
The external factors that could kill even great protocols:
- Regulatory compliance approach
- Geographic risks and restrictions
- Market correlation with broader crypto
- Competition and moat sustainability

## Learning in Public: My Current Analysis

I'm currently evaluating three protocols using this framework:
- **Aave** - Established lending protocol with strong technical foundation
- **Compound** - Pioneer in DeFi lending with governance evolution
- **Uniswap** - DEX infrastructure with proven product-market fit

Next week I'll share detailed breakdowns of each, including where they excel and where I see risks.
