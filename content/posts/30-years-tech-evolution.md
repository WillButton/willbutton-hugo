# The Blue-Collar Route to Tech Mastery

No computer science degree. No prestigious university. Just Navy nuclear training, relentless curiosity, and a willingness to rebuild my knowledge base every decade.

Here's what I've learned about staying relevant in tech for three decades - and why my current DeFi learning journey follows the same pattern.

## The Major Transitions I've Navigated

### 1990s: Network Admin Era
**The Foundation:** Physical infrastructure, protocols, and systems
- Token ring to Ethernet evolution
- Novel to Windows NT server transitions  
- Learning TCP/IP when it wasn't obvious
- **Key Lesson:** Master the fundamentals, ignore the hype

### 2000s: The Web Revolution
**The Pivot:** From infrastructure to applications
- Static HTML to dynamic web applications
- Database-driven architectures
- Early e-commerce platforms
- **Key Lesson:** Technical skills without business context are worthless

### 2010s: Cloud and DevOps Era  
**The Acceleration:** Infrastructure as code, automation
- Physical servers to AWS/Azure/GCP
- Manual deployments to CI/CD pipelines
- Monoliths to microservices architecture
- **Key Lesson:** Embrace tools that eliminate toil

### 2020s: Web3 and DeFi (Current)
**The Unknown:** Decentralized protocols and tokenomics
- Traditional finance to DeFi mechanisms
- Centralized to decentralized architectures
- Learning new economic models at 50+
- **Current Lesson:** Apply proven learning frameworks to new domains

## The Pattern: How I Learn New Tech Domains

### Phase 1: Map the Landscape (Month 1-3)
- Identify the key players and thought leaders
- Understand the problem being solved
- Learn the vocabulary without judgment
- Find reliable information sources

**DeFi Example:** Started with Bankless, Coin Bureau, and protocol documentation. Ignored price speculation, focused on mechanisms.

### Phase 2: Get Your Hands Dirty (Month 4-6)
- Build something small but real
- Break things in a safe environment
- Connect new concepts to existing knowledge
- Document everything

**DeFi Example:** Small liquidity provision experiments, yield farming with "play money," tracking results systematically.

### Phase 3: Teach and Share (Month 7+)
- Explain concepts to others (forces clarity)
- Share failures and lessons learned
- Build credibility through transparency
- Connect with community

**DeFi Example:** This blog, documenting my learning journey with engineering discipline applied to protocol evaluation.

## Staying Relevant After 40: The Hard Truths

### What Changes:
- Slower information absorption
- More skeptical of new trends
- Higher stakes for career pivots
- Less tolerance for "fake it till you make it"

### What Improves:
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Better business judgment
- Deeper technical foundations
- Network effects from decades of relationships

### The Secret Weapon: Systems Thinking
Every major tech transition shares common patterns:
- New abstraction layers hiding complexity
- Economic incentives driving adoption
- Network effects creating winners
- Integration challenges requiring experienced practitioners

## My Current DeFi Learning Approach

1. **Start with First Principles:** What problems do these protocols actually solve?
2. **Apply Risk Frameworks:** 30 years of evaluating tech infrastructure pays off
3. **Learn in Public:** Share the journey, including mistakes and confusion
4. **Connect to Traditional Finance:** Bridge existing knowledge with new mechanisms
5. **Focus on Sustainability:** What works long-term, not just current hype?

## Next: Specific DeFi Protocol Analysis

Next week I'll share my detailed evaluation of three major protocols, showing exactly how I apply decades of tech evaluation experience to DeFi.
